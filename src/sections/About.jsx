                 I am a motivated Front-End Developer specializing in React.js, 
                 with hands-on experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications.
                 I have completed online courses in front-end development and strengthened my
                 skills by working on real-world projects.

              </p>
              <p>
               I have developed a Netflix clone and an e-commerce application using React,
               Redux for state management, and Firebase for authentication and data handling.
               I have experience integrating REST APIs to fetch and manage dynamic data,
               ensuring smooth performance and a seamless user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
               I focus on writing clean, reusable components, managing application state efficiently,
               and building user-friendly interfaces. I am passionate about learning new technologies, 
               improving my problem-solving skills, and growing as a developer by working on challenging projects.
               I am actively seeking an entry-level front-end role where I can contribute my skills,
               gain industry experience, and continue learning.
